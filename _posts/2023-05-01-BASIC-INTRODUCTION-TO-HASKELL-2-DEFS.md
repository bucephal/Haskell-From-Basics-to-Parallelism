# Defining Functions

The identity function may be the simplest one. It taskes an “x” and simply returns that “x”.

```haskell
identity x = x
identity "hello"
"hello"
```

The name of a function like "identity" must start with a lower case letter. Then comes its parameters' list followed by an "=" and an expression for its value or result.
