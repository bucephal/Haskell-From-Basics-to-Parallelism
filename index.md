_Learning Haskell: Languaage basic, Type system, Class Types, From functor to Monad, Parallelism for free._
This blog will introduce Haskell from FP basic features to recursivity, laziness, and type system. From the type system we'll introduce class types, which will allow us to cover the very important types from functors and applicatives to monads, i.e. contexts with a state. We can then tackle parallelism and determine how easy and automatic it should be with the purity of Haskell. We'll determine whether the promises of purity are met by how easy it is to parallelize the programming. To this end, a number of experiments will be carried out.

To learn Haskell basic principles, we'll follow these textbooks:

Programming Haskell, 2nd ed. Graham Hutton, Cambridge University Press, 2016.

Get Programming with Haskell, Will Kurt, Manning, 2018

Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell: Techniques for Multicore and Multithreaded Programming, Simon Marlow, O'Reilly, 2013
