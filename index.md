_Learning Haskell: Languaage basic, Type system, Class Types, From functor to Monad, Parallelism for free._

This blog introducse Haskell from FP basic features from recursivity, to laziness, and type system. 

Class types will follow. This will allow us to begin with the introduction of the very important functors, applicatives and monads. We'll see how Haskell uses them to cleanly separate pure FP from stateful contexts and IO. Finally, we will look at parallelism in Haskell. We hope to evaluate Haskell's promises of purity by how easy it is to parallelize programming. To this end, several experiments will be conducted.

To learn Haskell basic principles, we'll follow these textbooks:

Programming Haskell, 2nd ed. Graham Hutton, Cambridge University Press, 2016.

Get Programming with Haskell, Will Kurt, Manning, 2018

Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell: Techniques for Multicore and Multithreaded Programming, Simon Marlow, O'Reilly, 2013
